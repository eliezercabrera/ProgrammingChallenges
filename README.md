# Recreational Programming

This repository houses an assorted collection of programming challenges that I complete on my free time for fun.

I do not systematically solve every challenge from every source, so this is an incomplete collection. Furthermore, I have solved challenges that I have not archived to this repository (e.g. all Project Euler's problems through the 59th).

I have standardized how I organize the code, data files, and problem descriptions recently (late 2019).

This repository mostly serves an archival purpose, so I do not tend to the accesibility of this code.

Furthermore, because I solve these challenges for fun, I also do not tend to their readability. In fact, I purposely use complicated logic or constructs for some challenges. Sometimes I even play code golf.

While I do not like Haskell for big projects, I think it is perfect for this kind of challenges, and thus I use it almost always.

Build files or logic are not included, as most problems are solved with a single file of code.

## Daily Programmer

Contrary to its name, challenges are released three times a week. Each week has an easy, medium, and hard challenges. It is a subreddit, i.e. /r/dailyprogrammer.

## Project Euler

These challenges are heavy on maths, particularly number theory. They generally become more challenging as they go on.

## Nerdy Programmer

Small collection of assorted challenges. The challenges are fantasy or sci-fi themed, which resembles the style of some programming competitions. Also a subreddit, but it is now dead.

## Hackerank

Popular website for programming challenges, interview preparation, contests, and even actual technical interviews. I have not archived the vast majority of Hackerrank problems I have solved.

## Riddles

These are actually logic puzzles. They do not require programming, but some of them are fun or easy to solve with code. These mainly come from YouTube channels.

## Linear Ordering, and Forward Chaining  
Two C++ programs I wrote during my artificial intelligence class. I will move this to its own repository soon, and I might make it private in order not to facilitate cheating.
