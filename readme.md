Assorted collection of programming challenges. I completed these challenges on my free time, so I have not solved every challenge from the sources, and I also have incomplete records. For example, I have completed every Euler challenge up to the 59th one.

Although varying in difficulty, most of them do not require more than one file of code to complete, nor makefiles or other forms of project organization. I used *Visual Studio* when solving with C++ for convenience, though.

I used mostly Haskell and C++ to solve the problems. Using *Haskell* has given me a new perspective when using *C++*.

Note: The large amount of HTML is caused by a report produced by Criterion, a benchmarking tool for Haskell.

The challenges are divided into directories:

###Daily Programmer

Contrary to its name, challenges are released three times a week. Each week has an easy, medium, and hard challenge.

###Project Euler

These challenges are more heavy on the math, especially in number theory. They become more challenging as they go on.

###Nerdy Programmer

Small collection of assorted challenges. The challenges are fantasy or sci-fi themed, which resembles the style of some programming competitions.

###Linear Ordering, and Forward Chaining

Two C++ programs I wrote during my artificial intelligence class.
